## Overview

Landing page! 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size [Yes]
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page [I did not have the correct icons, so I did not do all, but the button works, when I get the right icons I will redo it.]

## My process

Step by step, one block at a time. Something I am working on. However in this one it was not clean at ALL. Very messy. Will make follow-ups in the morning. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

There was nothing new I learned, which is unfortunate and not a good thing; but I did use things I have learned recently and I kept repeating those reminders when I was confused, and I also learned the pure value of using borders to help make sense of what is happening when flexbox is not listening to me. <3


### Continued development

flexbox; - this is a must, however, I am going through a path so its a little ways off, but I will still read more and still use it to get it down to muscle memory, I understand the basics, however I still get confused and have to repeat the 'flex doesnt care about the other kids, just direct containers' and have to look carefully and put it all in boxes again. then use borders to see where the boxes are and if its correct. so defintely need to work on that. 

google-fonts; i need to see why sometimes they dont work? right now, on my laptop they work, but its happened twice where they wont when locally downloaded and added with font-face media property. i did read the css-tricks link on how to use the property again to make sure i was not messing it up, i seem to be doing it right. so a bit confubbled there. 

design-ui-visual.etc skills; mine are deplorable, so i will need to step up there. 

responsive; again, far off right now, i dont know how to make things responsive, i know basic media queries, but not enough, so i look forward to progressing there. 

cleaner/neater coding habits; i feel as if mine is all a mess and it needs work; right now i feel like i am still in there 'if it works it works fudge how it looks' phase and i think after now almost 2.5 months its time to get out of it!!!!! so this one is BIG
